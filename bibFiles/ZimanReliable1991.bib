Ziman discusses both questions in a very thoughtful  way. But still, differences between epistemological aims and methods in  those sciences and in the humanities must lead to quite different  conceptions of reliability and authority. And whatever we say about the  latter, for digital humanities those aims and methods must, I'd think,  fall somewhere between the two. What does reliability look like when you  use computational techniques to investigate cultural materials? How is  reliability achieved? To what degree is it valued? Certain questions in the human sciences can be resolved in a way that renders the matters they address stable for a long time, but these are relatively rare -- or seem so because once settled the achieving of an answer is forgotten, and if recalled, not valued very much after the lip-service has been paid. But surely there cannot be life in a discipline without constraints, without stability, without reliability against which to push. Comments?
